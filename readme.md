## Comments

Originally, this was a theme for the Mou Markdown editor. [But since this project is dead](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mou-1-0-markdown-editor-on-os-x-for-you#/comments) for some time now, I switched to MacDown some time ago. Fortunately, MacDown supports the identical Mou color theme syntax, so I didn't really have to change anything here...
